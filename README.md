# Addressable-LEDs-controlled-by-voltage-draw
In this project I monitor the voltage draw from my wireless charger and create different LED effects based on whether or not it is charging. It requires an Arduino board with at least one analog pin and one output pin, a stripe of addressable LEDs, and the Adafruit_Neopixel library. The analog pin will read the voltage draw from the charger and the output pin will control the LEDs. After wiring it use the serial monitor to read the voltage draw and determine valid ranges. The provided code only uses 2 ranges but can easily handle more by simply creating additional boolean functions to be called in wipe().
